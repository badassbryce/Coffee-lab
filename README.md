# Coffee-lab
School lab for a coffee ordering system

The system is created to be used by potential coffee stores. The system is created so customers can order and customize their coffee and set up a pickup. The system also keeps track of your inventory.
You can load your inventory data into the system, and everytime an order deleptes an item in the inventory. The system automatically substracts the item from your inventory. The customer can also set up 
a same day pickup order so they can pick a branch where they want to pickup the coffee order from.
